# Objects

- Objects have two kinds of things in them: 
    1. **Member Variables** -> Data Associated with the Class
    2. **Methods**          -> It Describe the Behaviour or the Functionality of the object

- Objects in Java is like a Capsule which holds both the Data and Function

# Constructor

- Inside the Constructor we have 2 Colours Blue and Brown

    1. Blue: A Member Variable Associated with Class.
    2. Brown: Parameter passed in and only lives for the life of the constructor. 

- <Type> <name> = new <type>();
