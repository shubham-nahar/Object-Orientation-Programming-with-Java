# Getter Setter

- Ways of Changing the Value in a Decalared Constructor:

    1. Change the Value in the Constructor -> You can Call a Constructor only once, When You're Creating the Object at the Beginning.
    2. Access the Member Variable Directly -> It  Breaks Encapsulation as To access you will have to set Member Variable to Public.
    3. **Creating a Setter and Changing the Value by calling the Object.**
